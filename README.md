# Screens Script
With this script the opportunities are endless. You can create as many screens as you want with a single script.

## Description

- This particular script lets you create as many dui screens you want with 4 simple steps
- Steps
    - Create a ox lib polyzone around the room where the screen is present. 
    - Create a target polyzone for the screen to target on.
    - Go to the maps folder, look for the texture dictionary and texture name of the screen you want to use
    - Add all the information in client/zones.lua as I have done in the example

## Dependencies

- If you have a custom mlo and have a screen in there which you want to use with this script, make sure you make the polyzones and target before you ask in my discord on how to find texture dictionary and texture name. I can only help with the texture dictionaries and texture name if you do the other steps first.
